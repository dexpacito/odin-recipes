# odin-recipes

tryna learn how to make a recipes site with the help of odin project...
orbital project milestone 1 is due in 8 days oops.

21/5 i have now learned how to use css to style the fonts and change the text sizes, also that classes and IDs can be used to specify where u want the changes to be implemented specfically i think that is pretty cool.
